Problem 3 - CipertextMessage

Given an encrypted message, if you know the shift used to encode the message,
decoding it is trivial. If message is the encrypted message, and s is the shift
used to encrypt the message, then apply_shift(message, 26-s) gives you the
original plaintext message. Do you see why?

The problem, of course, is that you donâ€™t know the shift. But our encryption
method only has 26 distinct possible values for the shift! We know English is
the main language of these emails, so if we can write a program that tries each
shift and maximizes the number of English words in the decoded message, we can
decrypt their cipher! A simple indication of whether or not the correct shift
has been found is if most of the words obtained after a shift are valid words.
Note that this only means that most of the words obtained are actual words.
It is possible to have a message that can be decoded by two separate shifts
into different sets of words. While there are various strategies for deciding
between ambiguous decryptions, for this problem we are only looking for a
simple solution.
